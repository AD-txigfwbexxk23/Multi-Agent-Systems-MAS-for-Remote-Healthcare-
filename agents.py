#Notes:
"""
Goal:
- Explain step-by-step how to solve a given medical related issue to someone experiencing crisis 

Captain/Manager/Boss:
- Expert paramedic; oversees the operation
- Manages the workflow for subordinate agents and presents the final advice to the user
- Will need to identify the type of emergency, delegate tasks to specific employees, and communicate step by step what to do while inclduing automation transparency


Employees/Experts to hire:
- Symptom Analysis Agent: Classifies the severity of the issue
- Protocol Advisor Agent: Retrieve and adapt specific medical protocols based on the emergency type
- Trust Enhancer Agent: Improve the userâ€™s confidence in the system and explain what each agent is doing
- Risk Assesment Agent: Assess risks and decide what solutions could be best
- Verification Agent (1), (2), (3): Checks the output with other AI systems


Notes:
- Agents should be results driven and have a clear goal in mind
- Role is their job title
- Goals should actionable
- Backstory should be their resume
